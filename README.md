# N-Queens-Visualizer
The N Queens Visualizer project is an interactive tool designed to visually demonstrate the solution to the classic N Queens problem. The N Queens problem involves placing N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. This means that no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.
