The N Queens Visualizer is an interactive tool designed to visually demonstrate the solution to the classic N Queens problem. The N Queens problem involves placing N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. This means that no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.

Features
Interactive Visualization: Watch as the algorithm dynamically places queens on the board, showing the step-by-step process of finding a solution.
Algorithm Selection: Choose between different algorithms (e.g., backtracking, genetic algorithms) to see how various methods solve the problem.
Customizable Board Size: Adjust the size of the chessboard (N) to see how the problem scales and how solutions differ for various values of N.
Performance Metrics: View real-time performance statistics such as time taken and number of iterations, giving insight into the efficiency of the chosen algorithm.
User-Friendly Interface: A clean and intuitive interface that makes it easy to understand the problem and the solution process, even for those new to algorithmic problem solving.
